        <p><b>America</b> and<b> Iran</b> ended negotiations in Geneva with some “guiding principles” for a <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/09/04/irans-imminent-nuclear-dilemma" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_1:gobbet_1">nuclear</a> deal, according to Iran’s foreign ministry. America has not yet commented. Iran said that American envoys had moved towards “a more realistic” position. Earlier Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, spoke with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog.</p>

        <p><b>Warner Bros Discovery</b>, a movie-making giant, is restarting talks with <b>Paramount</b> about a potential deal. In December <b>Netflix</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2026/01/22/the-battle-for-warner-bros-is-only-getting-fiercer" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_2:gobbet_2">announced</a> it would pay $83bn for Warner’s streaming and studio services; Paramount then offered $108bn for the whole company, but its bid was rejected. Paramount has appealed to shareholders directly and reportedly increased its offer, though it has not made the figure public.</p>

        <p><b>Tarique Rahman</b> was sworn in as<b> </b>prime minister, after his party won <b>Bangladesh’s</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2026/02/05/the-new-bangladesh-is-only-half-built" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_3:gobbet_3">first general election</a> since Sheikh Hasina, a despot, was toppled in 2024. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2026/02/02/an-election-will-decide-whether-democracy-returns-to-bangladesh" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_4:gobbet_3">Bangladesh National Party’s</a> return to power, after nearly 20 years, marks a profound shift in Bangladesh’s politics. Mr Rahman has pledged to fight graft—the BNP’s undoing last time—and preserve freedom of speech.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The<b> European Commission</b> began a probe into <b>Shein</b>, a fast-fashion giant. The EU’s executive arm will look into <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/02/20/shein-attempts-to-mend-its-public-image-before-its-london-debut" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_5:gobbet_4">the Chinese firm’s</a> sale of illegal products and investigate whether its online marketplace is designed to be addictive. In November a court in Paris decided that a three-month suspension of Shein’s website was “disproportionate” after an investigation found that it was selling childlike sex-dolls and machetes.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>BHP</b>, the world’s biggest mining company by market capitalisation, reported stronger-than-expected half-year results, driven by soaring demand for <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/10/23/trumponomics-is-warping-the-worlds-copper-markets" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_6:gobbet_5">copper</a>. The Australian group said revenue rose by 11% year on year to $27.9bn in the six months to the end of December. Net profit rose by nearly 30%. Shares in the company opened 7.5% higher.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lawmakers in New Mexico passed legislation to launch an investigation into Zorro Ranch, a mansion owned by<b> Jeffrey Epstein</b>. The dead sex offender allegedly trafficked and abused girls and women there. A bipartisan committee will investigate which <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2026/02/12/inside-epsteins-network" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_7:gobbet_6">ranch guests and state officials</a> may have known. Meanwhile Thomas Pritzker, a hotel magnate, stepped down as Hyatt’s executive chair after documents revealed his ties to Epstein.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Jesse Jackson</b>, a leader of America’s civil-rights movement, died aged 84. Mr Jackson first gained political attention in the 1960s as a protégé of Martin Luther King junior. After <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2018/07/05/a-different-dream" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_8:gobbet_7">King’s assasination in 1968</a>, Mr Jackson became a figurehead and twice ran for president. Though unsuccessful, Mr Jackson’s campaigns in the Democratic primaries made him one of the most well-known campaigners for black political rights in America.</p>
