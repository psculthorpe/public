      <title>World in Brief - February 17, 2026</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Oil prices rose ahead of negotiations between <b>Iran</b> and <b>America</b> in Geneva on Tuesday. Donald Trump said he would be “indirectly” involved in the talks about Iran’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/09/04/irans-imminent-nuclear-dilemma" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_1:gobbet_1">nuclear programme</a>. Earlier America deployed a second aircraft-carrier to the Middle East, raising tensions. On Monday Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, held talks with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog.</p>

        <p><b>BHP</b>, the world’s biggest mining company by market capitalisation, reported stronger-than-expected half-year results, driven by soaring demand for <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/10/23/trumponomics-is-warping-the-worlds-copper-markets" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_2:gobbet_2">copper</a>. The Australian group said revenue rose by 11% year on year to $27.9bn in the six months to the end of December. Net profit rose by nearly 30%. Shares in the company opened 7.5% higher.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Tarique Rahman</b> was sworn in as<b> </b>prime minister, after his party won <b>Bangladesh’s</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2026/02/05/the-new-bangladesh-is-only-half-built" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_3:gobbet_3">first general election</a> since Sheikh Hasina, a despot, was toppled in 2024. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2026/02/02/an-election-will-decide-whether-democracy-returns-to-bangladesh" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_4:gobbet_3">Bangladesh National Party’s</a> return to power, after nearly 20 years, marks a profound shift in Bangladesh’s politics. Mr Rahman has pledged to fight graft—the BNP’s undoing last time—and preserve freedom of speech.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lawmakers in New Mexico passed legislation to launch an investigation into Zorro Ranch, a mansion owned by<b> Jeffrey Epstein</b>. The dead sex offender allegedly trafficked and abused girls and women there. A bipartisan committee will investigate which <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2026/02/12/inside-epsteins-network" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_5:gobbet_4">ranch guests and state officials</a> may have known. Meanwhile Thomas Pritzker, a hotel magnate, stepped down as Hyatt’s executive chair after documents revealed his ties to Epstein.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The <b>Federal Reserve </b>plans to relax capital rules for American banks to encourage more mortgage lending, Michelle Bowman, its vice-chair for supervision, said. The changes would let banks adjust the capital they hold to reflect a loan’s risk, rather than apply a single standard for all mortgages. Officials argue that strict rules have pushed activity to <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/05/29/american-finance-always-unique-is-now-uniquely-dangerous" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_6:gobbet_5">non-bank lenders</a>.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Hapag-Lloyd</b>, the world’s fifth-largest container-shipping group, agreed to buy ZIM, an <b>Israeli </b>competitor, for $4.2bn. Carriers ordered record numbers of ships during the pandemic, but freight rates have now slumped and the industry is consolidating. Staff at ZIM went on strike to oppose the merger with the German company and Israeli officials raised national-security concerns. Israel’s competition authority will review the deal.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Jesse Jackson</b>, a leader of America’s civil-rights movement, died aged 84. Mr Jackson first gained political attention in the 1960s as a protégé of Martin Luther King junior. After <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-if/2018/07/05/a-different-dream" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_7:gobbet_7">King’s assasination in 1968</a>, Mr Jackson became a figurehead and twice ran for president. Though unsuccessful, Mr Jackson’s campaigns in the Democratic primaries made him one of the most well-known campaigners for black political rights in America.</p>
