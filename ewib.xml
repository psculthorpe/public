      <description><![CDATA[
        <p><b>Warner Bros Discovery</b>, a movie-making giant, is restarting talks with <b>Paramount</b> about a potential deal. In December <b>Netflix</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2026/01/22/the-battle-for-warner-bros-is-only-getting-fiercer" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_1:gobbet_1">announced</a> it would pay $83bn for Warner’s streaming and studio services; Paramount then offered $108bn for the whole company, but its bid was rejected. Paramount has appealed to shareholders directly and reportedly increased its offer, though it has not made the figure public.</p>

The money will go towards three energy and manufacturing projects, including a natural-gas plant in Ohio. Japan has pledged to invest around $550bn in America in exchange for the Trump administration limiting tariffs on Japanese exports to 15%.</p>

Meanwhile an American official said there remained “a lot of details to discuss” and that Iran would present proposals to address “gaps” within two weeks.

        <p>America said it had carried out two strikes on alleged <b>drug-trafficking boats</b> in the eastern Pacific, and a third in the Caribbean, killing 11 people. At least 144 people have been killed since September, when the Trump administration began targeting vessels carrying suspected “narco-terrorists” as part of its <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/10/13/the-new-war-on-drugs" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_6:gobbet_6">war on drugs</a>. The White House has <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/12/11/how-much-does-america-know-about-its-boat-strike-targets" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_7:gobbet_6">defended the attacks</a>, which some claim violate international law.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><b>Germany’s </b>population is expected to shrink faster than expected—by 5% over the next 25 years—according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research. The think tank updated its forecast of a 1% decline after the population count in 2025 was revised down from 85m to 83m. The number of people aged between 20 and 66 is expected to decrease by 12%, putting pressure <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2026/01/15/germanys-economy-is-so-bad-even-sausage-factories-are-closing" data-analytics="espresso_gobbets:link_9:gobbet_8">on the labour market</a> and pension system.</p>

        <p><b>Jesse Jackson</b>, a leader of America’s civil-rights movement, died aged 84. Mr Jackson first gained political attention in the 1960s as a protégé of Martin Luther King junior.

Though unsuccessful, Mr Jackson’s campaigns in the Democratic primaries made him one of the most well-known campaigners for black political rights in America.</p>
